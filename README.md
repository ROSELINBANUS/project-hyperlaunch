## About this Dataset:

This project explores the Data Science Salary dataset with the understanding trends in compensation across different roles, experience levels, and work settings in the data industry. It also applies machine learning to predict salaries based on various job features.

## Objectives:

*Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover patterns in the data

*Clean and preprocess the dataset using pandas & sklearn

*Visualize distributions and relationships using Seaborn & Matplotlib

*Detect and handle outliers using the IQR method

*Train a supervised machine learning model to predict salaries

*Evaluate model performance using RMSE, RÂ², MAE, etc

## Insights from the analysis:

*Experience level has a strong correlation with salary  executives and senior professionals earn significantly more on average.

*Remote work ratio impacts salary -fully remote jobs often offer competitive salaries.

*Roles such as Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Architects are among the highest paid.

*There are outliers where mid-level or even entry-level positions have surprisingly high salaries, possibly due to specific skills or location.
